# Problem to be solved:

The goal of this project is to develop a service that can scrape the content of any given URL and summarize it using a Large Language Model (LLM), such as ChatGPT. This will allow users to quickly digest key information from websites, improving their ability to access important details without having to read through long articles or webpages.

## Technical Specification of the Design:
* User Input: The service will accept a valid URL from the user.
* Content Scraping: Upon receiving the URL, the service will scrape the content of the webpage. This will involve extracting the text from the HTML structure, filtering out irrelevant elements such as ads or navigation bars.

* Text Summarization: The scraped content will then be passed to an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) for summarization. The LLM will condense the content into a shorter, more digestible version while maintaining key points.
* Response Output: The service will return the summarized text to the user in a structured response.

## How the Solution Achieves the Adminâ€™s Desired Outcome:

The solution directly addresses the user story of creating a service that summarizes text content from a website. Users can input a URL, receive summarized content from the website, and use the summarized version for quick insights. The use of a Large Language Model ensures that the summary is coherent and meaningful, adding significant value to the raw web content.


## Proof of Concept (PoC):

This solution serves as a PoC and is designed to demonstrate the core functionality of URL scraping and text summarization. As a PoC, the service may lack certain production-grade features, such as advanced error handling, robust security measures, and scalability optimizations.

## Limitations and Further Work for Production-Readiness:

1. ### Scalability:
   * Current Limitation: The app is designed to handle a relatively low volume of requests. It may struggle to scale to hundreds of thousands of jobs per day.
   * Future Work:
     *    Implement rate-limiting and load balancing to distribute requests across multiple servers.
      * Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) to process requests asynchronously and ensure that high volumes of requests do not overwhelm the system.
      * Introduce caching mechanisms to store summarized content for frequently requested URLs, reducing unnecessary processing.
  
  1. ### Security:
   * Current Limitation: The app does not have robust security measures in place. Scraping content from websites could lead to issues like scraping restricted sites or triggering anti-bot protections.
   * Future Work:
  
      *  Introduce user authentication and authorization to limit access to the service.
    
      *  Implement CAPTCHA verification for certain use cases and throttle scraping to prevent being blocked by websites.
        
     * Ensure that the scraping process respects robots.txt files and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
  2. ### Error Handling:
       * Current Limitation: The error handling is minimal, and failures in scraping or summarization are not well managed.
       * Future Work:
  
         * Implement better error logging and monitoring (e.g., using tools like Sentry or LogRocket).
         * Add retries and fallback mechanisms for cases where scraping or summarization fails.
         * Return meaningful error messages to users in case of failure (e.g., invalid URL, timeout, unsupported content).
  3. ### Content Parsing:
      * Current Limitation: The content scraping may not always yield perfect results due to the varied structures of web pages.
      * Future Work:
         
         * Implement more advanced parsing strategies, such as machine learning-based content extraction, to improve the accuracy and relevancy of scraped content.
